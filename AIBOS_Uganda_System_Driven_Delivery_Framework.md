## Section 0 — Executive Summary

### Purpose

This document is the operational blueprint for AIBOS Uganda's transformation from a person-dependent delivery model into a system-driven organization. It consolidates all agreed frameworks, processes, standards, and tools into a single reference that any team member — current or new — can use to understand how we work, what is expected, and how to contribute effectively.

### The Core Transformation Goal

| From                                          | To                                              |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Quality depends on specific individuals       | Quality is enforced by the system               |
| Communication happens when someone remembers  | Communication follows a defined protocol        |
| Decisions live in people's heads              | Decisions are documented and accessible         |
| Managers spend time firefighting              | Managers monitor, guide, and improve the system |
| Knowledge is lost when someone is unavailable | Knowledge lives in documentation and tools      |

### What This Document Covers

This framework addresses seven interconnected pillars:

1. **Standards** — SLAs, KPIs, and measurable expectations
2. **Operations** — Daily routines, meetings, and reporting
3. **Quality** — QA layers, ownership, release governance, and priority framework
4. **Communication** — Client and internal communication protocols
5. **Knowledge** — Documentation, Google Drive + docs/ repository, and internal vs. shared knowledge boundaries
6. **People** — Capacity building, skills mapping, hiring, and recognition
7. **Technology** — AI tools and shared team environments for sustainable scale

### How to Use This Document

- **New team members:** Read Sections 1–5 first for full context, then refer to specific sections as needed
- **Product Managers:** Sections 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are your primary operational reference
- **Developers:** Sections 6, 7, 11.3, and 13 are most relevant to your daily work
- **Leadership:** Sections 2, 3, 4, 14, and 15 provide governance and strategic overview
- **All team members:** Section 12 (Reward System) and Section 10.7 (Talent) apply to everyone's growth and day-to-day experience

## Section 1 — Background & Context

### 1.1 The Challenge: Client Feedback

AIBOS Uganda received structured feedback from client DATAGRID that highlighted recurring process gaps. These gaps are not unique to DATAGRID — they reflect systemic issues across all AIBOS Uganda operations, including internal projects. AIBOS Japan is also considered a client of AIBOS Uganda.

**Quality Issues Identified:**

- Deliverables submitted at a quality level that would not pass Japanese review standards
- Bugs that would be caught by basic testing are reaching the client
- Over-engineering beyond MVP scope — building features the client did not ask for

**Communication Issues Identified:**

- Tasks started based on misunderstood requirements
- Slow responses to client questions
- Deadlines not confirmed before work begins
- Task delays communicated on the due date rather than in advance
- Previously identified mistakes being repeated

### 1.2 The Root Cause: Person-Dependency

The underlying cause of these issues is not a lack of skill or knowledge. The root cause is structural:

> **The organization currently relies too heavily on specific individuals to maintain quality and communication standards. When those individuals are busy, unavailable, or overloaded, standards drop.**

This creates two problems:

- Talented individuals carry an unsustainable personal burden
- The organization cannot scale because performance is tied to people, not systems

### 1.3 The Goal

```
Current State                          Target State
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Talented individual carries quality    System enforces quality
Manager fixes every problem            Process prevents problems
Knowledge lives in one person          Knowledge lives in documentation
Communication depends on memory        Communication follows protocol
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### 1.4 What This Is and Is Not

| This IS                                | This is NOT                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| A process and systems initiative       | Punishment or blame for any individual   |
| A collective effort across all levels  | A performance review mechanism           |
| An opportunity to build better systems | A criticism of individual capability     |
| A foundation for AI-enabled growth     | A set of rules imposed from the top down |

### 1.5 Guiding Mindset

| Principle                       | Meaning in Practice                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mistakes are opportunities**  | Every problem found is a chance to build a system that prevents it from recurring |
| **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** | Once a mistake happens, we build a system so it never happens again               |
| **Team over individual**        | "Assignee" means "Owner" — the owner's job includes asking the team for help      |
| **Standards over individuals**  | If a process works for one person, document it so it works for everyone           |
| **Japan-Uganda as one team**    | Different contexts, same goal — building a company of global standard             |

## Section 2 — Organizational Structure & Roles

### 2.1 Responsibility Model

There are two types of responsibility in every activity:

| Role                 | Description                                                                                                  | Example                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Management Owner** | Bears ultimate responsibility. Assigns and oversees Execution Owners. Responsible for the system succeeding. | A manager who owns the meeting process — even if someone else facilitates |
| **Execution Owner**  | Fulfills responsibility within their defined scope. Accountable for their piece of delivery.                 | A PM who facilitates the standup as the Execution Owner of that meeting   |

**Key principle:** The Execution Owner is responsible for doing the work. The Management Owner is responsible for making sure the work gets done — including asking for help, removing blockers, and ensuring quality.

### 2.2 Initiative Ownership Structure

| Role                      | Person                                     | Scope                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Management Owner**      | Ambrose                                    | Overall ownership of SLA/KPI improvement initiative    |
| **Execution Owners**      | Martin, Joseph, and Project PMs            | Implementation and day-to-day execution                |
| **Advisor — Development** | Prakhar (Head of Development, AIBOS Japan) | Guidance on development process and rule changes       |
| **Advisor — Operations**  | Nate (Head of AIBOS Uganda)                | Guidance on Uganda structure and communication matters |

### 2.3 Japan-Uganda Leadership Responsibilities

| Leader  | Ultimate Responsibility                                                         |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Prakhar | Bridging the client and development team; approving development process changes |
| Nate    | Overall Uganda structure and operational functioning                            |
| Ambrose | Day-to-day management of the SLA/KPI system and delivery standards              |

### 2.4 Communication Channels

```
Type of Communication              Channel / Person
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
General questions and discussions  B1 Channel (visible to all)
Communication-related matters      Consult Nate
Development process / rule changes Consult Prakhar
Project-level daily updates        Daily Reports Channel
Client communication               Per project PM, following protocol
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

> **Note:** The B1 channel is the default for transparency. Direct messages should be used only for sensitive matters — everything operational should be visible to the team.

## Section 3 — SLA Framework

### 3.1 Overview

Service Level Agreements (SLAs) define the minimum standards of behavior expected from every team member. They are not guidelines — they are commitments. Meeting SLAs consistently is what builds trust with clients and within the team.

### 3.2 SLA Standards

| Area                     | Standard                                                                                    | Why It Matters                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Client Response Time** | First response within **15 minutes** during working hours                                   | Eliminates client anxiety about being ignored; builds trust          |
| **Deadline Management**  | Escalate delay risks **immediately upon recognition** — never on the due date               | Gives the client and team time to adjust; prevents surprise failures |
| **Requirements & Scope** | Confirm understanding **in writing** before starting work; MVP scope first                  | Eliminates work based on assumptions; prevents over-engineering      |
| **Quality Assurance**    | Two-stage check: **developer self-test → QA Owner verification** before any client delivery | Stops preventable bugs from reaching the client                      |
| **Meeting Management**   | **Pre-assign roles**; share decisions and next actions **same day**                         | Ensures meetings produce outcomes, not just discussions              |

### 3.3 SLA Monitoring

- SLA adherence is observed through the daily KPI log (see Section 4)
- Violations are not punitive — they are data points for system improvement
- Recurring violations in the same area trigger a process review

## Section 4 — KPI Framework

### 4.1 KPI Definitions

| KPI                                       | What It Measures                                                              | Good Result          |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **15-min response violations**            | Number of times a client message went unacknowledged for more than 15 minutes | 0 per week           |
| **Delay escalation rate**                 | Percentage of delay risks shared proactively (before the due date)            | 100%                 |
| **Pre-delivery bugs found in QA**         | Number of bugs caught internally before reaching the client                   | Track trend downward |
| **Post-delivery bugs reported by client** | Number of bugs the client found after delivery                                | 0 target             |
| **On-time delivery rate**                 | Percentage of tasks delivered on or before the agreed deadline                | 100% target          |

### 4.2 Collection & Review Cadence

| KPI                                  | Collected                   | Reviewed              |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| 15-min response violations           | Daily (PM logs per project) | Weekly (PDMO meeting) |
| Delay escalation rate                | Daily (PM logs per project) | Weekly (PDMO meeting) |
| Pre-delivery bugs found in QA        | Daily (QA Owner logs)       | Weekly (PDMO meeting) |
| Post-delivery bugs (client reported) | Daily (PM logs)             | Weekly (PDMO meeting) |
| On-time delivery rate                | Weekly (PM confirms)        | Weekly (PDMO meeting) |

### 4.3 KPI Dashboard

**Tool:** Google Sheets (stored in the team Google Drive under Operations/KPI Tracking/)

**Structure — One Sheet per Project, One Summary Tab:**

| KPI                               | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Weekly Total | Target      |
| --------------------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------------ | ----------- |
| 15-min response violations        |     |     |     |     |     |              | 0           |
| Delay risks escalated proactively |     |     |     |     |     |              | 100%        |
| Pre-delivery bugs found in QA     |     |     |     |     |     |              | Log & trend |
| Post-delivery bugs (client)       |     |     |     |     |     |              | 0           |
| On-time delivery                  |     |     |     |     |     |              | 100%        |

**Rules:**

- Each PM fills their project's row during the **evening retrospective**
- Management Owner reviews the full summary tab every **Tuesday** in the PDMO meeting
- Japan team (Prakhar/Nate) has view access at all times
- An empty cell by EOD is flagged as a potential gap

**Summary Tab Format:**

| Project        | Response SLA | Delay Escalation | Pre-delivery Bugs | Client Bugs | On-time Rate | Overall                    |
| -------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ------------ | -------------------------- |
| Create Project |              |                  |                   |             |              | ON TRACK / WATCH / BLOCKED |
| EMS            |              |                  |                   |             |              |                            |
| FOCUST         |              |                  |                   |             |              |                            |
| AI Phone Agent |              |                  |                   |             |              |                            |

## Section 5 — Daily Operational System (The Daily Pulse)

### 5.1 Overview

The Daily Pulse is the operational heartbeat of AIBOS Uganda. It ensures every working day begins with alignment and ends with validated progress. It is structured as two loops — a morning setup loop and an evening validation loop.

### 5.2 The Daily Pulse Flow

```
MORNING LOOP
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
09:00 │ COMPANY STANDUP (6–10 min)
      │ All teams. High-level alignment on the day.
      │ Focus: priorities, blockers, team spirit
      ▼
09:10 │ TEAM PREPARATION MEETING (10 min)
      │ Each team internally. Led by the PM.
      │ Focus: technical alignment, task clarity, who owns what
      ▼
09:20 │ PM → MANAGEMENT OWNER SYNC
      │ PMs report urgent blockers to the Management Owner.
      │ Focus: anything that needs management attention before the day runs
      │ Output: Management Owner aware of all critical risks before 09:30
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

WORK DAY
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
      │ Teams execute. PMs monitor. Blockers escalated immediately.
      │ Client responses follow the 15-min protocol (Section 7).
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

EVENING LOOP
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
16:30 │ TEAM PEER REVIEWS (30 min)
      │ Led by PM. All team members.
      │ Focus: review staging environment, cross-check each other's work
      │ QA Owner runs smoke test checklist
      ▼
17:00 │ STATE OF PRODUCT CONFIRMATION
      │ PM confirms product status for the day
      │ Focus: what is done, what is at risk, what needs escalation
      ▼
17:15 │ MANAGEMENT MEETING
      │ Ambrose, Martin, Joseph
      │ Focus: company-wide daily status, unresolved blockers, decisions
      ▼
17:30 │ EOD REPORT TO CHANNEL
      │ PM posts standardized daily report
      │ Audience: Client + Internal Management
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### 5.3 Morning Standup Guidelines

- Maximum 10 minutes — no problem-solving in the standup
- Each person answers: What did I do? What will I do today? Any blockers?
- Blockers are noted and addressed in the PM sync that follows

### 5.4 Team Preparation Meeting Guidelines

- Maximum 10 minutes
- Led by the Project PM
- Technical focus: task ownership, dependencies, environment status
- Output: every team member knows their exact task for the day

### 5.5 PM → Management Owner Sync

- Brief and focused — only urgent items
- PMs report: anything that could affect client delivery, deadlines, or team capacity
- Management Owner makes immediate decisions on anything critical
- Non-urgent items go to the PDMO weekly meeting

## Section 6 — Quality Assurance System

### 6.1 Philosophy

Quality is not an individual's responsibility — it is the system's output. When a bug reaches the client, the question is not "who wrote the bug?" but "which layer of the QA system failed to catch it?"

The goal is to make it structurally difficult for poor quality to reach the client.

### 6.2 The 4-Layer QA Filter

```
CODE WRITTEN BY DEVELOPER
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  LAYER 1: PEER REVIEW   │  Developer's code is reviewed by a
│  (Daily)                │  peer before any merge.
│  Who: Team members      │  Focus: logic, standards, edge cases
└────────────┬────────────┘
             │ Passes
             ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  LAYER 2: SMOKE TEST    │  PM or backup member runs a standard
│  (Per Deployment)       │  checklist of critical features.
│  Who: QA Owner / PM     │  Focus: "Does the core still work?"
└────────────┬────────────┘
             │ Passes
             ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  LAYER 3: CROSS-TEAM    │  PM from another team tests the
│  EXPLORATORY TEST       │  product with fresh eyes.
│  (Weekly — PDMO)        │  Focus: UI, user flow, unexpected bugs
│  Who: Other PMs         │
└────────────┬────────────┘
             │ Passes
             ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  LAYER 4: AUTOMATED     │  Unit and integration tests run
│  TESTS                  │  automatically on every code push.
│  (Continuous)           │  Focus: regressions, edge cases
│  Who: Development team  │
└────────────┬────────────┘
             │ All layers pass
             ▼
       DELIVERED TO CLIENT
```

If any layer fails, the item goes back to the developer — it does not move forward.

### 6.3 QA Ownership

**Role Definition — QA Owner:**

| Responsibility     | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pre-delivery check | Reviews every deliverable before it goes to the client using the Definition of Done checklist |
| Bug gate           | Anything not ready goes back to the developer — no exceptions                                 |
| KPI logging        | Logs pre-delivery bugs found in the daily KPI sheet                                           |
| Smoke test lead    | Runs the standard checklist after every deployment to staging                                 |
| Escalation         | If a deliverable has critical gaps close to deadline, escalates to PM immediately             |

**Named QA Owners per Project:**

| Project             | QA Owner                | Backup QA Owner         | Rotation (Every) |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| Create Project (BP) | To be nominated by team | To be nominated by team | 2–3 months       |
| EMS                 | To be nominated by team | To be nominated by team | 2–3 months       |
| FOCUST              | To be nominated by team | To be nominated by team | 2–3 months       |
| AI Phone Agent      | To be nominated by team | To be nominated by team | 2–3 months       |

> **Process:** Each team nominates their QA Owner by **March 1** (aligned with Phase 1 of the Implementation Roadmap). Criteria: not the person who wrote the feature being tested; understands the product well; has time allocated for QA duties alongside delivery work.

> **QA Owner Roles:** Runs the smoke test checklist on every staging deployment; signs off on the DoD checklist; logs pre-delivery bugs in the KPI sheet; escalates to PM when quality is at risk before a deadline. The QA Owner is the team's last line of defence before the client sees any work.

> **See Appendix H for the QA Owner Appointment Form.**

**Rotation Policy:**

- QA Owner rotates every 2–3 months
- This builds QA competency across the whole team
- The outgoing QA Owner briefs the incoming one before handover

### 6.4 Definition of Done (DoD) Checklist

Before any feature or task can be marked complete, the following must all be true:

```
DEFINITION OF DONE — CHECKLIST
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
□  Requirements confirmed in writing before work started
□  Developer has self-tested the feature
□  Code has been peer-reviewed
□  Feature works as expected in the staging environment
□  No obvious bugs or broken flows in staging
□  QA Owner has reviewed and signed off
□  Documentation updated if required (in /docs)
□  Client notified if delivery is imminent
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

A Pull Request cannot be merged to staging unless the DoD checklist is confirmed.

### 6.5 Two-Environment Standard

| Environment           | Purpose                                         | Who Accesses It                         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Development (Dev)** | Active feature development and testing          | Developers only                         |
| **Staging**           | Client acceptance testing; PM and QA validation | PM, QA Owner, Client (where applicable) |
| **Production**        | Live, stable, client-facing system              | Client and end users only               |

**Rule:** No feature goes to Production without passing through Staging and receiving confirmation.

### 6.7 Project Priority Framework

Managing quality requires knowing what to protect most. Not all features carry the same risk when things change — this framework categorizes features by priority and ensures that any change is assessed for impact before it is applied.

#### Priority Levels

| Priority          | Label            | Definition                                                                        | Stability Rule                                                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P0 — Critical** | Core / Always On | Features that must work at all times. Failure here is unacceptable to the client. | No changes without full QA sign-off and a documented rollback plan.  |
| **P1 — High**     | Core Workflow    | Features essential to the main user journey. Bugs here are high-urgency.          | Changes require staging validation before any production deployment. |
| **P2 — Standard** | Supportive       | Secondary features or enhancements. Bugs are tolerable temporarily.               | Standard QA process applies.                                         |
| **P3 — Low**      | Nice-to-Have     | Minor features or cosmetic improvements.                                          | Can be deferred without client impact.                               |

> **Rule:** P0 features are never modified without a documented risk assessment and rollback plan. If a P0 feature is at risk of being broken by a change, that change must wait for a safe deployment window.

#### Risk Assessment Requirement

Before any change to a P0 or P1 feature, the PM and QA Owner must complete a brief risk assessment:

```
CHANGE RISK ASSESSMENT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Feature Being Changed:              [Name / Module]
Priority Level:                     P0 / P1 / P2 / P3
What is changing:                   [Brief description]
Potential impact on other features: [List affected areas]
Can it be reverted if it fails:     Yes / No
Rollback steps if needed:           [Step-by-step rollback]
Who approves:                       [PM + QA Owner]
Client informed?                    Yes / No / Not required
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

#### Rollback Protocol

Every P0 and P1 deployment must have a documented rollback plan before it is merged to Production.

```
Deployment goes to Production
         │
    ┌────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ Smoke test passes within 30 minutes?             │
    └────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    Fails│
         ▼
Immediately execute rollback:
  1. Revert to last stable Production deployment
  2. Notify PM and QA Owner
  3. PM notifies client with brief honest message
  4. Root cause identified before next attempt
```

#### Client Communication on Priority Changes

Any update that affects P0 or P1 features must be communicated to the client **before** deployment, not after.

**Template — Planned Change Notification:**

> _"Hi [Client Name], we are planning to deploy an update to [Feature/Module] on [Date]. This addresses [brief description]. Internal testing is complete and a rollback plan is in place. If you have any concerns, please let us know before [Time]. We will confirm the outcome in our daily report."_

> **See Appendix I for the full Risk Assessment & Rollback Plan template.**

## Section 7 — Communication Protocol

### 7.1 The 15-Minute Response Rule

Every client message received during working hours must receive a first response within **15 minutes**. This does not mean the issue must be solved in 15 minutes — it means the client must know their message has been received and is being handled.

### 7.2 The Three-Path Decision Tree

```
CLIENT MESSAGE RECEIVED
         │
         ▼
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ Can you answer this RIGHT NOW?      │
    └──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
           │               │
          YES              NO
           │               │
           ▼               ▼
    ┌──────────┐    ┌───────────────────────────────┐

                     │ in 1 hr  │    │ (end of day) │
                     └──────────┘    └──────────────┘
```

### 7.3 Response Templates (Ready to Use)

**Path A — Immediate Response:**
Direct answer to the client's question, accurate and concise.

---

**Path B — Investigation Acknowledgment:**

> "Hi [Client Name], thank you for your message regarding [Topic]. I have flagged this with the team and we are currently reviewing the details. I will get back to you with a status update within the hour.
> Best regards, [Name]"

---

**Path C — Long-Term Acknowledgment:**

> "Hi [Client Name], thank you for reaching out about [Topic]. This requires a deeper review of [Area/Module]. We are looking into it and will provide a full status update in our end-of-day report, or sooner if resolved.
> Best regards, [Name]"

---

**1-Hour Update (for Path B):**

> "Hi [Client Name], a quick update: we have identified that the issue is related to [Area]. We are currently [testing/refining/investigating] the solution. I will confirm the final outcome in our daily report.
> Best regards, [Name]"

### 7.4 The 1-Hour Pulse Rule

If a Path B acknowledgment was sent, the Execution Owner must:

- Set a timer after sending the acknowledgment
- Provide a status update within 1 hour — even if the issue is not yet resolved
- Never let a client question go into the next day without a summary in the EOD report

### 7.5 Risk Escalation Process

```
Risk or delay identified by Developer/PM
         │
         ▼
Immediately notify PM (if not already the PM)
         │
         ▼
PM assesses impact on deadline
         │
         ▼
PM notifies the Management Owner at once
         │
         ▼
Management Owner decides:
  ├── Can the team handle it?  →  Team adjusts, client informed proactively
  └── Needs escalation?        →  Consult Prakhar/Nate same day
         │
         ▼
Client notified with:
  - What the risk is
  - Current impact on timeline
  - What the team is doing to address it
  - When the next update will come
```

> **Rule:** A delay communicated proactively is manageable. A delay communicated on the due date is a failure of the system.

### 7.6 What "Good Communication" Looks Like

| Scenario                         | Poor Practice              | Good Practice                                       |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Requirements unclear             | Start work, assume         | Stop. Confirm in writing before starting            |
| Task will be delayed             | Say nothing until due date | Escalate as soon as the risk is recognized          |
| Client asks a technical question | Wait until fully resolved  | Acknowledge in 15 min, update in 1 hour             |
| Bug found after delivery         | Hope client doesn't notice | Notify client immediately with resolution plan      |
| Meeting decision made            | Forget by next day         | Post decisions and next actions in channel same day |

## Section 8 — Reporting System

### 8.1 Daily Progress Report

The daily progress report serves **two audiences simultaneously** — the client and internal management. One message, consistent format, sent to the relevant channel at end of day.

**Template:**

```

### 8.3 Client Reporting Guidelines

| Principle       | Detail                                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Frequency**   | Daily (via EOD report)                                                         |
| **Tone**        | Professional, honest, confident                                                |
| **On delays**   | Proactive — notify the moment risk is recognized                               |
| **On bugs**     | Transparent — report immediately with resolution plan                          |
| **On progress** | Specific — avoid vague "in progress" without detail                            |
| **Language**    | Clear and simple — avoid heavy technical jargon unless the client is technical |

### 9.2 Company Standup

| Item          | Detail                                                          |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Duration**  | 6–10 minutes                                                    |
| **Frequency** | Daily, Monday to Friday                                         |
| **Purpose**   | Company-wide alignment on daily priorities                      |
| **Format**    | Each person: What did I do? What will I do today? Any blockers? |
| **Rule**      | No problem-solving in the standup — flag and address separately |

### 9.3 Team-Level Product Meetings (15 Minutes)

These sessions happen immediately after each team's regular weekly meeting. They are the foundation of the product management rhythm.

**Purpose:**

- Align on product priorities for the week
- Complete the weekly product checklist
- Surface blockers, bottlenecks, and missed requirements early

**Attendees:**

- All team members (mandatory)
- Project Manager (leads)
- Product Managers from other teams (optional — for cross-team learning)

**Confirmed Schedule:**

| Team           | Meeting Day | Time                     |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| SNS            | Monday      | After 14:00 team meeting |
| AI Phone Agent | Tuesday     | After 10:30 team meeting |
| Create Project | Wednesday   | After 12:00 team meeting |
| EMS            | Thursday    | After 11:00 team meeting |
| FOCUST         | Friday      | After 10:00 team meeting |

> **Early validation:** The Create Project team's pilot session identified workflow bottlenecks and missed requirements, which were assigned and actioned immediately — directly demonstrating the value of this format.

## Section 10 — Capacity Building & Continuity

### 10.1 The Problem This Solves

When a key person is unavailable, projects should not stall. When a team member is not available, knowledge should not be inaccessible. This section establishes the systems that make AIBOS Uganda resilient.

### 10.2 The Shadow / Backup System

For every project, there is a **Primary** lead and a **Shadow**. The Shadow is not a passive observer — they are an active participant who stays informed and is ready to take over at any point.

| Project        | Primary Lead    | Shadow / Backup | Shadow Responsibilities                                            |
| -------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Create Project | To be confirmed | To be confirmed | Attends prep meetings, CC'd on client comms, aware of all blockers |
| EMS            | Martin / Andrew | To be confirmed | Same as above                                                      |
| FOCUST         | FOCUST PM       | To be confirmed | Same as above                                                      |
| AI Phone Agent | Kevin           | To be confirmed | Same as above                                                      |

**Shadow Rules:**

- Shadow attends the team's product meeting every week
- Shadow is CC'd on all significant client communication
- If Primary is unavailable, Shadow steps in immediately with no ramp-up delay
- Shadow must be able to give a 5-minute status of the project at any time

### 10.3 Delegation Framework

Managers should move from doing to overseeing:

```
TODAY (Person-Dependent)          TARGET (System-Dependent)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Manager writes every report       PM team rotates report writing
Manager monitors every project    KPI dashboard monitors projects
Manager answers every question    Response protocol handles it
Manager catches every bug         QA system catches bugs
Manager holds all knowledge       Documentation holds knowledge
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

**Rotational Reporting:**

- Daily reports are not always written by the same person
- PMs rotate the reporting duty among team members
- This ensures every team member understands project status and can communicate it clearly

**Manager's New Role Checklist:**

| Old Activity                    | New Activity                             |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Writing reports                 | Reviewing reports for quality            |
| Answering every client question | Ensuring the protocol is followed        |
| Catching bugs personally        | Verifying the QA layer caught them       |
| Knowing every detail            | Knowing where the details are documented |

### 10.4 Technical Sharing Sessions as Capacity Engine

TSS sessions should actively build team capacity, not just share information passively.

**Active TSS Format:**

| Phase         | Duration | Description                                                                     |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Presentation  | 20 min   | Team presents a technical topic, decision, or implementation                    |
| Q&A           | 8 min    | Other teams ask questions — minimum 1 question per attendee                     |
| Documentation | 2 min    | Key points saved to Google Drive and posted in the team channel within 24 hours |

**Cross-pollination rule:** The Shadow for a project should lead the Q&A for that project's TSS presentation — they have the most to learn and the most responsibility to stay current.

### 10.5 The SOP Library (Standard Operating Procedures)

**Rule:** If a task is done more than twice, it must have a written "How-To" guide.

SOPs are stored in Google Drive under **Operations/SOPs/** for organizational procedures, or in the project's `/docs` folder for project-specific procedures.

**Minimum SOP for any recurring task:**

```
SOP: [Task Name]
─────────────────────────
Purpose: What this task achieves
When to use: Trigger or frequency
Steps:
  1. ...
  2. ...
  3. ...
Owned by: [Role]
Last updated: [Date]
─────────────────────────
```

### 10.6 Team Skills Map

Understanding what each team member does best is critical for task assignment, cross-team assistance, and targeted capacity building. The Skills Map is a living reference that grows as team members develop — it is not a performance evaluation, but a practical tool for PMs and management to match the right people to the right work.

#### Purpose of the Skills Map

| Use Case              | How the Skills Map Helps                                               |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Task assignment       | PMs assign based on proven strength, reducing delivery risk            |
| Cross-team assistance | When Team A needs support, Team B can identify who has the right skill |
| Capacity planning     | Managers can spot skills gaps before a new project begins              |
| Career development    | Team members know what to build next to fill gaps                      |

#### Skills Map — Frontend Department

| Team Member | Core Strength              | Secondary Strength      | Learning Area   | Available for Cross-Support |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- |
| [Name]      | [e.g., React / Next.js UI] | [e.g., API integration] | [e.g., Testing] | Yes / Limited / No          |
| [Name]      |                            |                         |                 |                             |
| [Name]      |                            |                         |                 |                             |

**Skill categories for Frontend:**

- UI component development (React / Next.js)
- State management (Redux, Zustand, Context API)
- API integration and data handling
- Responsive design and accessibility
- Performance optimization
- Testing (Jest, Playwright, Cypress)
- Design implementation (Figma → Code)

#### Skills Map — Backend Department

| Team Member | Core Strength             | Secondary Strength      | Learning Area  | Available for Cross-Support |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------- |
| [Name]      | [e.g., Node.js / Express] | [e.g., Database design] | [e.g., DevOps] | Yes / Limited / No          |
| [Name]      |                           |                         |                |                             |
| [Name]      |                           |                         |                |                             |

**Skill categories for Backend:**

- API development (REST / GraphQL)
- Database design and optimization (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
- Authentication and security
- Cloud infrastructure and deployment
- Automated testing and CI/CD pipelines
- Microservices and system architecture
- Integration with third-party services and AI/LLM APIs

#### How to Maintain the Skills Map

- The Skills Map template lives in Google Drive under **Teams/[Department]/**
- Each PM reviews the map **quarterly** and updates entries after significant project completions
- Team members can self-nominate updated strengths — the PM validates through direct observation
- Skills Map feeds into the TSS calendar — members strong in an area are the natural lead presenter for that topic

> **See Appendix J for the Skills Map completion template.**

### 10.7 Hiring & Talent Management

#### The Right Person for the Right Task

Given the current team size and available resources, the most impactful decision AIBOS Uganda can make is to intentionally match each person to tasks they do well. This is not about limiting growth — it is about building confidence, delivering quality, and giving each individual room to become excellent before expanding their scope.

**The benefits are immediate:**

- Delivery quality improves because the person best suited to the task owns it
- Developer morale increases because people feel competent and valued, not overwhelmed
- Accountability is clearer when people own work they genuinely understand
- Quality work done confidently feeds directly into the recognition system — reinforcing a positive cycle

#### Morale and Task Assignment

| Assignment Style                           | Impact on Morale                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Assigned to area of strength               | Confidence, flow, quality output, willingness to take on more           |
| Assigned to unknown areas without support  | Stress, slow delivery, self-doubt, quiet disengagement                  |
| Assigned with mentorship and a growth plan | Managed challenge, supported learning, long-term capability development |

**For managers:** Before assigning a stretch task (outside someone's confirmed strengths), confirm:

- Is there someone available to mentor them through it?
- Is the deadline realistic for a learn-as-you-go scenario?
- Does the team member know this is a growth assignment, not just another delivery task?

#### Growth Path and Career Development

The Reward & Motivation System (Section 12) is designed to reinforce and support individual career development. The link between task assignment, recognition, and growth looks like this:

```
PM assigns work aligned to strength (Skills Map)
         │
Member delivers quality work
         │
Recognition in Tuesday PDMO highlight
         │
Contribution noted in KPI dashboard
         │
Quarterly: TSS Lead Slot or Growth Acknowledgment
         │
Member's contributions documented in Google Drive grow as a track record
         │
Natural growth into new responsibilities over time
```

#### When Hiring

As the team grows, new hires should be evaluated against the Skills Map — filling documented gaps rather than adding redundant strengths. Each new hire should:

- Be assigned a Shadow mentor from day one
- Have their skill profile added to the relevant department Skills Map
- Receive a clear first-90-days plan aligned to a specific project or workstream

## Section 11 — Documentation & Knowledge Management

### 11.1 Philosophy

> **If it is not documented, it does not exist as a standard.**
> **If it is documented, it is assumed to be intentional.**

Documentation is not a chore — it is the mechanism by which individual knowledge becomes organizational knowledge. The DRY principle applies here too: document once, reference everywhere.

### 11.2 C2-PdMO Templates

The C2-PdMO (Product Design & Management Office) framework provides the standard document lifecycle for all projects.

**Document Lifecycle:**

```
Step 1: Define product vision        →  product.md
Step 2: Capture requirements         →  requirement-list
Step 3: Map functions                →  function-list
Step 4: Design architecture          →  architecture, tech, infrastructure, ADRs
Step 5: Track execution              →  weekly-tech-check
```

**Approval Gates:**

| Gate   | Name         | Required Documents                             |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **G1** | Scope Lock   | product doc, requirement-list, function-list   |
| **G2** | Design Gate  | architecture, tech stack, infrastructure, ADRs |
| **G3** | Release Gate | All tests pass, design-gate-checklist complete |

> **Rule: No code until G2 is passed.**

**Template Map:**

| Phase     | Document                 | Purpose                               |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Planning  | product.md               | Vision, goals, users, success metrics |
| Planning  | requirement-list         | What users need and why               |
| Planning  | function-list            | What the system does                  |
| Design    | architecture.md          | How the system is structured          |
| Design    | tech.md                  | Approved technology stack             |
| Design    | infrastructure.md        | Cloud resources and configuration     |
| Design    | adrs/                    | Architecture Decision Records         |
| Execution | weekly-tech-check.md     | Health status and blockers            |
| Execution | design-gate-checklist.md | Approval checkpoints                  |

**Reference:** [C2-PdMO Sample Meta on GitHub](https://github.com/aibos-dev/matrix-reorganization/tree/docs/c2-pdmo/02_Resources/sample-meta/docs/c2-pdmo)

### 11.3 Repository Documentation Standard

Every project repository must maintain a `/docs` folder with the following structure:

```
/docs
├── c2-pdmo/
│   ├── 1-planning/
│   ├── 2-design/
│   └── 3-execution/
│       └── YYYY-MM-DD-weekly.md
└── README.md
```

**ADR (Architecture Decision Record) Process:**

```
New architectural question arises
         │
         ▼
Create ADR (Proposed) — document the options and rationale
         │
         ▼
Review with team and Prakhar (if needed)
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    │Accepted?│
    └────┬────┘
  No ◄───┴───► Yes
  │                │
  Mark rejected    Update architecture.md
  (keep for        Mark ADR as Accepted
  history)         Supersede any prior ADR
```

**Rules:**

- Every major architecture change starts as an ADR
- `architecture.md` always reflects the current accepted state
- Superseded ADRs are kept for historical reference

### 11.4 Google Drive & Repository — Knowledge Management System

AIBOS Uganda uses a two-tier knowledge system that separates organizational knowledge from project-level technical documentation.

```
GitHub /docs    →  Technical documentation (C2-PdMO, ADRs, weekly checks)
Google Drive    →  Organizational knowledge (SOPs, templates, guidelines, meeting outputs)
```

**Tier 1 — Project Repository (/docs)**
Already defined in Section 11.3. Each project repository maintains a `/docs` folder containing C2-PdMO planning documents, architecture records, and execution logs. This is the technical record for that specific project.

**Tier 2 — Google Drive (Shared Organizational Knowledge)**
The team Google Drive serves as the central location for all non-code organizational knowledge — templates, SOPs, skills maps, guidelines, KPI tracking sheets, and meeting outputs.

**Recommended Google Drive Folder Structure:**

```
AIBOS Uganda (Shared Drive)
├── Operations/
│   ├── Templates/          ← All framework templates (Appendices A–M)
│   ├── SOPs/               ← Standard Operating Procedures
│   ├── TSS Summaries/      ← Weekly Technical Sharing Session summaries
│   └── KPI Tracking/       ← Google Sheets KPI dashboards per project
├── Projects/
│   ├── [Project Name]/
│   │   ├── Client Comms/   ← CLIENT-FACING documents
│   │   ├── Internal/       ← INTERNAL project documents
│   │   └── Handover/       ← Shadow handover records
├── Teams/
│   ├── Frontend/           ← Skills Map, department SOPs
│   └── Backend/            ← Skills Map, department SOPs
└── Shared with Clients/    ← Copies of documents shared externally
```

**Access Control:**

| Folder                        | Access Level                                  |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Operations/                   | All team members (view), PMs + Management Owner (edit) |
| Projects/[Name]/Client Comms/ | PM + Management Owner (edit), client (view on request) |
| Projects/[Name]/Internal/     | Project team (edit), Management Owner (view)           |
| Teams/                        | All team members (view), PMs + Management Owner (edit) |
| Shared with Clients/          | PM + Management Owner (edit), client (view)            |

**Governance Rules:**

- Product team is the primary custodian of the Drive folder structure
- Every template from this framework (Appendices A–M) is stored in Operations/Templates/
- Undocumented practices are not considered standards — if it matters, it goes in Drive or /docs
- New folders should follow the structure above; ad-hoc top-level folders are not permitted

### 11.5 External Knowledge Sharing

As internal documentation matures, AIBOS Uganda will begin publishing external technical content.

| Channel             | Purpose                            | Quality Standard                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Medium (initial)    | Technical blogs from TSS content   | Solves a real problem; not generic AI-generated content |
| AIBOS Blog (future) | Company-owned technical publishing | Curated, quality-reviewed                               |

**Connection to TSS:** A TSS session can motivate a blog post, or a blog post can be presented in TSS. Both reinforce learning and external visibility.

**Ownership:** Product team initiates and manages quality control. Engineering teams are the authors.

### 11.6 Internal vs. Shared Knowledge Boundary

Not all documentation is meant for the client. A clear, consistent boundary between what is internal-only and what is shared with the client protects the team, maintains trust, and ensures clients receive the right level of transparency — without unnecessary exposure of internal processes, systems, or discussions.

#### Knowledge Classification Categories

| Category                      | Classification    | Description                                                | Examples                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Client-Facing**             | Always shared     | Created specifically for client communication              | Daily progress reports, release notes, delivery confirmations, requirement confirmations |
| **Client-Accessible**         | Shared on request | Available to the client if asked, but not proactively sent | Approved technical specs, staging links, test plans, deployment schedules                |
| **Internal — Project**        | Internal only     | Used by the project team for execution                     | ADRs, architecture docs, peer review comments, bug trackers, QA logs, KPI logs           |
| **Internal — Organizational** | Internal only     | Organizational operations, not project-specific            | Team performance data, capacity plans, KPI dashboard scores, team health discussions     |
| **Restricted**                | Leadership only   | Sensitive to business or personnel                         | Personnel matters, financial discussions, strategic decisions not yet finalized          |

#### Decision Guide — Is This Shareable with the Client?

```
Document created or updated
         │
         ▼
Does it contain team personnel info, financials, or internal KPIs?
  Yes → RESTRICTED / INTERNAL ONLY
  No  → Continue
         │
         ▼
Was it created specifically for client communication?
  Yes → CLIENT-FACING (send proactively)
  No  → Continue
         │
         ▼
Does it help the client understand what was built or confirmed?
  Yes → CLIENT-ACCESSIBLE (share on request or attach to delivery)
  No  → INTERNAL — PROJECT
```

#### Always Internal vs. Always Shared — Quick Reference

| Always Internal                           | Always Shared with Client                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| QA bug logs and pre-delivery test results | Delivery confirmation and release notes         |
| KPI dashboard scores per team             | Daily progress report (EOD)                     |
| Peer review and code review comments      | Requirement confirmations (before work starts)  |
| Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)      | Staging environment link for acceptance testing |
| Team capacity and Skills Map data         | Timeline and delivery schedule                  |
| Internal escalation and risk records      | Delay notifications (proactive)                 |
| Shadow assignments and backup plans       | Feature change requests (confirmed scope)       |

#### Tagging Documents in Google Drive

When saving documents in Google Drive, include the classification tag in the file name or document description:

- `[CLIENT-FACING]` — place in Projects/[Name]/Client Comms/ or Shared with Clients/
- `[INTERNAL]` — place in Projects/[Name]/Internal/ or Operations/
- `[RESTRICTED]` — place in a leadership-only subfolder with restricted access

This prevents accidental sharing and helps new team members understand what belongs in client communications from day one.

## Section 12 — Reward & Motivation System

### 12.1 Philosophy

> **Systems sustain behavior. Recognition energizes it.**

At AIBOS Uganda's current stage, the most powerful rewards are **recognition and growth opportunity**, not just monetary incentives. The reward system should feel like _"this person made the team stronger"_ — not a competition.

Recognition must be:

- Specific (tied to a real action or KPI outcome)
- Genuine (not generic praise)
- Consistent (not occasional)
- Framed around system contribution (not individual heroics)

### 12.2 Tier 1 — Weekly Recognition (Zero Cost)

Every Tuesday PDMO meeting includes a **"Team Highlight"** — one specific shoutout for a team or individual that exemplified the SLA/KPI standards that week.

This is posted in the team channel after the meeting.

**Examples of strong framing:**

- _"This week the FOCUST team reported a delay risk on Tuesday — three days before the deadline — giving us time to adjust. That is exactly the culture we are building."_
- _"AI Phone Agent had zero client-reported bugs this week. The QA layer worked exactly as designed."_

### 12.3 Tier 2 — Monthly KPI-Linked Awards

At the end of each month, review the KPI dashboard and recognize:

| Award                      | Criteria                                     | Recognition                                                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Best Response Rate**     | Fewest 15-min response violations            | Shoutout + noted in monthly summary to Japan               |
| **Cleanest Delivery**      | Lowest post-delivery bugs reported by client | Shoutout + featured in PDMO summary                        |
| **Best QA Catch**          | Most pre-delivery bugs caught internally     | Shoutout — framed as "protected the team"                  |
| **Proactive Communicator** | Most delay risks escalated early             | Shoutout — framed as "showed leadership"                   |
| **Documentation Champion** | Best/most consistent documentation update    | Shoutout — connection to Google Drive / docs/ contribution |

### 12.4 Tier 3 — Quarterly Growth Reward

The top performing team member per quarter receives a **TSS Lead Slot** — they choose a topic of their interest and present it to the whole company.

This is a growth opportunity, not just a trophy:

- Builds the individual's profile internally
- Develops their communication and technical articulation skills
- Connects to the external blog initiative — their TSS becomes their first published blog post

**If budget allows:** A small monetary acknowledgment or team experience (team lunch, etc.) to accompany the TSS slot.

### 12.5 How to Frame Recognition

| Avoid                       | Use Instead                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "You worked very hard"      | "You protected the team by escalating early"                       |
| "Good job"                  | "Your QA catch prevented a client issue this week"                 |
| "You're the best developer" | "Your documentation means the next person can pick this up easily" |

The goal is to make excellence feel systemic and replicable, not exceptional and individual.

### 12.6 AIBOS Swag & Tangible Recognition

As AIBOS Uganda grows, tangible recognition becomes an important complement to the verbal and written acknowledgment system. Branded swag serves both as a reward and as a visible symbol of belonging to a team that values quality — something people are proud to carry or wear.

#### Phase-Appropriate Rollout

| Phase           | Milestone                                    | Items                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Starter**     | On joining + first 90-day completion         | Branded notebook, pen, sticker pack                      |
| **Recognition** | Quarterly top performer or project milestone | AIBOS branded t-shirt or hoodie                          |
| **Milestone**   | 1-year anniversary or major project launch   | Higher-value item (jacket, backpack, or team experience) |

**Framing swag with meaning:** Swag should always be accompanied by a specific reason — it is not a participation trophy. The story is what makes the item memorable:

> _"This hoodie goes to the FOCUST team for completing the beta launch on time with zero client-reported bugs. That is the standard we are building this team around."_

### 12.7 Overtime & Extra-Mile Recognition

#### Why It Needs Its Own Category

Extra hours put in during a crunch period, a critical release, or an emergency are often invisible in standard KPI-based recognition. Without acknowledgment, repeated overtime builds quiet resentment — even among people who genuinely care about the work.

AIBOS Uganda recognizes extra-mile effort as a distinct and important category of contribution.

#### Recognition Model for Overtime

| Type of Effort                            | Recognition Approach                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Late-night deployment or emergency fix    | Named shoutout in next-day morning standup                                    |
| Critical task completed over the weekend  | Acknowledged in the following Tuesday PDMO highlight                          |
| Consistently staying late during a sprint | Noted in the monthly summary shared with Japan                                |
| Going beyond scope to unblock a teammate  | PDMO callout framed as: _"This person made it possible for the team to ship"_ |

> **Important balance:** Recognition of overtime is not an invitation to normalize it. The PM who acknowledges the effort should also ask: _"What process gap caused this crunch? How do we prevent it next time?"_ Overtime recognition and process improvement go hand in hand.

#### Compensatory Time

Where overtime has been significant and sustained, managers should consider compensatory time (time off in lieu) as a practical acknowledgment. This should be discussed and confirmed with Nate as appropriate for each situation.

### 12.8 Contribution Recognition System

#### The Problem It Solves

In most teams, the most lasting contributions — writing the guide that helped everyone, cleaning up the codebase, documenting the architecture others struggled to understand — happen quietly and go unnoticed. The KPI-based system risks rewarding visible delivery metrics while overlooking equally impactful work that does not show up in a dashboard.

#### Contribution Types Worth Recognizing

| Contribution                                                              | Why It Matters                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Documenting a complex process in Google Drive or the project docs/ folder | Saves every future team member hours of confusion     |
| Writing an SOP the whole team now follows                                 | Makes the organization more resilient                 |
| Mentoring a junior member through a difficult task                        | Multiplies capability across the team                 |
| Identifying and fixing a systemic issue proactively                       | Protects the team before a problem reaches the client |
| Proposing a process improvement that is adopted                           | Demonstrates system-thinking and leadership           |
| Leading a TSS session that other teams found valuable                     | Builds cross-team knowledge and external visibility   |

#### The "Under-the-Radar" Contribution Shoutout

In the weekly Tuesday PDMO summary, a recurring segment: **"This Week's Under-the-Radar Contribution"**

- Any PM or team member can nominate a contribution — not limited to KPI metrics
- One nomination per week is highlighted in the team channel

**Sample post:**

> _"This week's contribution shoutout goes to [Name] for documenting the EMS deployment process in Google Drive. Three team members already referenced it — it paid off immediately."_

#### Long-Term: Individual Contribution Profile

As the documentation library in Google Drive and the project repos grows, each team member will have a **Contribution Profile** — a record of what they have built, documented, and shared. This becomes a career development artifact:

- Referenced during quarterly reviews
- Shared where appropriate with Japan leadership
- Used as the basis for TSS nominations and growth opportunities
- Serves as an internal portfolio for individual progression at AIBOS Uganda

## Section 13 — MVP to Production Framework

### 13.1 The Recurring Challenge

Across multiple AIBOS Uganda projects, the same pattern has emerged: an MVP is built quickly to demonstrate a concept, and almost immediately the client expects it to function as a production-ready system. This has caused:

- Scope creep without proper planning
- Quality gaps because MVP code was not designed for production
- Team stress from rapid, unstructured transitions
- Feature additions without client confirmation (e.g., dark mode, extra features)

### 13.2 Stage Definitions

| Stage          | Definition                                                    | Quality Expectation                         | Client Visibility               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **MVP**        | Built to validate feasibility or demonstrate a concept        | May include shortcuts; not production-grade | Internal / invited preview only |
| **Demo**       | Presentation-focused; optimized for clarity over completeness | Not assumed production-bound                | Stakeholder preview on staging  |
| **Beta**       | Feature-complete but still being validated and stabilized     | Near-production quality                     | Client tests on staging         |
| **Production** | Stable, tested, and deployed for real users                   | Meets all QA gates                          | Live — client and end users     |

### 13.3 Transition Guidelines

Before any stage transition, the following must be confirmed:

```
MVP → Demo
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
□  Core concept validated internally
□  No unconfirmed extra features added
□  Scope explicitly agreed with client

Demo → Beta
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
□  Requirements fully documented
□  Architecture reviewed (G2 gate passed)
□  Client aware this is still a validation stage

Beta → Production
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
□  All QA layers passed
□  Staging environment stable and client-tested
□  Client has confirmed readiness
□  Release governance completed
□  Production smoke test passed
```

### 13.4 Environment Flow

```
DEVELOPER
    │
    ▼
DEV environment
(feature built and developer-tested)
    │
    ▼
STAGING environment
(QA Owner reviews; client validates specific features)
    │
Client confirms
    ▼
PRODUCTION environment
(Feature released; monitoring active)
    │
    ▼
EOD report updated
```

### 13.5 Client Confirmation for Extra Features

> **Before adding any feature beyond the original scope, the PM must confirm with the client:**
> _"We are planning to add [Feature X]. Is this something you would like included?"_

This applies even when the feature seems helpful or proactive. A feature built without confirmation is a feature the client may not want to pay for.

### 13.6 Project Intake Process

Every new client project or major scope change must pass through the Product team before implementation begins.

```
Client submits new project / request
         │
         ▼
Product team receives and reviews
(Management Owner + relevant PM)
         │
         ▼
Product team assesses:
  - What is the scope?
  - What phase does it start at? (MVP/Beta/Production)
  - What team / resources are needed?
  - What is the delivery timeline?
         │
         ▼
Product team briefs the implementation team
         │
         ▼
G1 gate: Requirements documented
         │
         ▼
Implementation begins
```

```

### 14.2 Phase 1 — Foundation (Feb 23 – Mar 15)

**Goal:** Prepare the system. Build awareness. Assign ownership.

| Action                                                                | Owner         | Target Date |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Share and review this framework document                              | Management Owner       | Feb 27      |
| Nominate QA Owners for each project                                   | Each team              | Mar 1       |
| Set up KPI tracking sheet (Google Sheets)                             | Management Owner       | Mar 1       |
| Confirm shadow assignments per project                                | Management Owner + PMs | Mar 7       |
| Brief full team on daily pulse and SLA expectations                   | Management Owner + PMs | Mar 10–14   |
| Set up Google Drive folder structure (Operations/, Projects/, Teams/) | Product team  | Mar 14      |

### 14.3 Phase 2 — Trial Operation (Mar 16 – Mar 31)

**Goal:** Run the system. Identify friction. Adjust.

| What Goes Live                                                 | Notes                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Daily Pulse (standup → prep → sync → peer review → EOD report) | Full cadence from day one             |
| KPI daily logging begins                                       | Each PM fills their row every evening |
| 15-min response protocol                                       | All teams begin tracking              |
| QA Owner role activated                                        | DoD checklist used for every delivery |
| Weekly PDMO meeting running                                    | Tuesday 14:00 EAT                     |
| Team product meetings running                                  | Per confirmed schedule                |

**Review points:** Management Owner reviews what is working and what feels "clunky" — adjustments made before April.

### 14.4 Phase 3 — Proving Period (Apr 1 – Apr 30)

**Goal:** Confirm adoption. Measure outcomes. Build confidence.

| Metric                                                 | Target                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 15-min response violations                             | Trending toward zero                |
| Delay risks escalated proactively                      | 80%+ of the time                    |
| Post-delivery bugs reported by client                  | Significant reduction from baseline |
| KPI sheet filled consistently                          | 90%+ completion rate                |
| Team able to operate without the Management Owner present for a day | Yes                    |

At the end of April, a review meeting with Prakhar and Nate confirms whether the system is functioning and what the next phase looks like.

### 14.5 Phase 4 — AI Tools & Shared Environment (May)

**Goal:** Once the operational foundation is stable, introduce AI tools and a shared team environment to accelerate delivery and reduce cost.

**Areas to roll out (see Section 15 for full detail):**

- Claude Code for automated test generation and code review support
- AI-assisted documentation drafting for Google Drive and project docs/ entries
- Automated KPI reporting from existing data sources
- Shared team VM / server environment setup (1 shared account model)

**Prerequisites before Phase 4 begins:**

- Phase 3 Proving Period (April) confirms system is functioning
- KPI sheet at 90%+ fill rate consistently
- QA Owner roles active and rotational handover documented
- At least one full TSS cycle completed

> **Important:** AI tools are introduced to accelerate a working system — not to fix a broken one. The April proving period must confirm system stability before this phase begins.

## Section 15 — AI Tools & Shared Team Environment

### 15.1 Philosophy

> **AI tools are introduced to accelerate a working system — not to fix a broken one.**

The AI integration plan for AIBOS Uganda is deliberately staged. The operational foundation (Sections 3–14) must be stable and adopted before AI tools are layered on top. When that foundation is in place, AI can compress timelines, reduce repetitive work, and allow the team to focus on higher-value decisions.

### 15.2 AI Tools for Managers and Teams

The following areas are planned for AI tool integration (see Section 14.5 — Phase 4):

| Area                     | AI Application                                                                  | Benefit                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Code review**          | AI-assisted code review (e.g., Claude Code) to supplement the QA layer          | Faster catch of standard errors; developers get immediate feedback |
| **Test generation**      | Automated unit and integration test generation from code                        | Reduces manual test writing; improves regression coverage          |
| **KPI reporting**        | Automated reporting from existing data sources                                  | Reduces time spent manually compiling weekly reports               |
| **Documentation**        | AI-assisted drafting of Google Drive documents, SOPs, and project docs/ entries | Faster documentation; encourages consistent formatting             |
| **Requirement analysis** | AI review of requirement documents for gaps or ambiguities                      | Catches missing edge cases before development starts               |

#### Tools in Scope (Phase 4 — May onwards)

- **Claude Code** — AI coding assistant for development and automated test generation
- **AI-assisted review** — Supplement to peer code review; identifies common issues quickly
- **Automated KPI dashboarding** — Scripts or integrations that pull data from existing channels into the dashboard automatically

> **Important:** Managers should be trained to use AI tools to review, guide, and audit — not to replace judgment. AI output is always reviewed by a human before any client-facing use.

### 15.3 Shared Team Environment

As AIBOS Uganda grows, access to AI tools and development infrastructure should be structured for cost efficiency and team-wide access — not fragmented across individual personal accounts.

#### The Shared VM / Server Workspace Model

Rather than each team member maintaining their own separate accounts and local environments, AIBOS Uganda will move toward a **shared team server environment**:

```
SHARED TEAM WORKSPACE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1 Virtual Machine / Server  →  Accessible by whole team
1 Shared Account (per tool) →  Used by all team members
Centralized environment     →  Consistent setup, no "works on my machine"
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

#### Why This Model

| Challenge (Individual Accounts)                              | Solution (Shared Environment)                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Each developer maintains a separate AI tool subscription     | One shared account reduces cost significantly                 |
| Environment inconsistencies cause "works on my machine" bugs | One server environment means everyone runs the same setup     |
| Onboarding a new team member requires full environment setup | New members connect to existing server — ready in minutes     |
| AI tool costs scale with headcount                           | Shared model scales at a fraction of individual-account costs |

#### Implementation Notes

- The shared VM should be set up as part of the **Phase 4 rollout (May)**
- Access control: each team member has their own login to the VM, but shares the AI tool account credentials via a secure, centrally managed method (e.g., team password manager)
- The VM environment setup should be documented in Google Drive (Operations/SOPs/) as the standard development environment going forward
- As the team grows and usage demands increase, this model can be upgraded (more compute, additional accounts) — but the shared foundation keeps early-stage costs manageable

#### Cost Efficiency Over Time

```
Small Team (Today)
  1 shared account — cost fixed regardless of team size
         │
         ▼
Growing Team (6–12 months)
  Same account, more users — still 1 subscription cost
         │
         ▼
Scaled Team (12+ months)
  Evaluate: 1 upgraded tier vs. multiple accounts
  Decision informed by actual usage data
```

> **Note:** This model works best for internal development and AI tools. Client-facing systems, production accounts, and individual authentication for billing-critical services should remain separate for security and accountability.
